Introduction
This document provides a sample configuration of a Cisco IOS® based access point for Extensible
Authentication Protocol (EAP) authentication of wireless users against a database accessed by a RADIUS
server.
Due to the passive role that the access point plays in EAP (bridges wireless packets from the client into wired
packets destined to the authentication server, and vice versa), this configuration is used with virtually all EAP
methods. These methods include (but are not limited to) LEAP, Protected EAP (PEAP)−MS−Challenge
Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) version 2, PEAP−Generic Token Card (GTC), EAP−Flexible
Authentication via Secure Tunneling (FAST), EAP−Transport Layer Security (TLS), and EAP−Tunneled TLS
(TTLS). You must appropriately configure the authentication server for each of these EAP methods.
This document covers how to configure the access point (AP) and the RADIUS server, which is Cisco Secure
ACS in the configuration example in this document.
Prerequisites
Requirements
Ensure that you meet these requirements before you attempt this configuration:
      • You are familiar with the Cisco IOS GUI or CLI.
      • You are familiar with the concepts behind EAP authentication.
Components Used
The information in this document is based on these software and hardware versions:
       • Cisco Aironet AP products that run Cisco IOS.
       • Assumption of only one Virtual LAN (VLAN) in the network.
       • A RADIUS authentication server product that successfully integrates into a user database.
               ♦ These are the supported authentication servers for Cisco LEAP and EAP−FAST:
                        ◊ Cisco Secure Access Control Server (ACS)
                        ◊ Cisco Access Registrar (CAR)
                        ◊ Funk Steel Belted RADIUS
                        ◊ Interlink Merit
               ♦ These are the supported authentication servers for the Microsoft PEAP−MS−CHAP version 2
                  and PEAP−GTC:
                        ◊ Microsoft Internet Authentication Service (IAS)
                        ◊ Cisco Secure ACS
                        ◊ Funk Steel Belted RADIUS
                        ◊ Interlink Merit
                        ◊ Any additional authentication server Microsoft can authorize.
                  Note: GTC or One−Time Passwords require additional services which require additional
                  software on both the client and server side, as well as hardware or software token generators.
               ♦ Consult the manufacturer of the client supplicant for details on which authentication servers
                  are supported with their products for EAP−TLS, EAP−TTLS and other EAP methods.
The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the
devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, make sure
that you understand the potential impact of any command.

Configure
This configuration describes how to configure EAP authentication on an IOS based AP. In the example in this
document, LEAP is used as a method of EAP authentication with RADIUS server.
Note: Use the Command Lookup Tool ( registered customers only) to obtain more information on the commands
used in this section.
As with most password−based authentication algorithms, Cisco LEAP is vulnerable to dictionary attacks. This
is not a new attack or new vulnerability of Cisco LEAP. The creation of a strong password policy is the most
effective way to mitigate dictionary attacks. This includes the use of strong passwords and the periodical
expiration of passwords. Refer to Dictionary Attack on Cisco LEAP to get more information about dictionary
attacks and how to prevent them.
This document uses this configuration for both GUI and CLI:
       • IP address of the AP is 10.0.0.106.
       • IP address of the RADIUS server (ACS) is 10.0.0.3.
Network EAP or Open Authentication with EAP
In any EAP/802.1x based authentication method, you can question what the differences are between Network
EAP and Open authentication with EAP. These items refer to the values in the Authentication Algorithm field
in the headers of management and association packets. Most manufacturers of wireless clients set this field at
the value 0 (Open authentication), then signal a desire to do EAP authentication later in the association
process. Cisco sets the value differently, from the start of association with the Network EAP flag.
If your network has clients that are:
       • Cisco clientsUse Network−EAP.
       • Third party clients (include CCX compliant products)Use Open with EAP.
       • A combination of both Cisco and third party clientsChoose both Network−EAP and Open with EAP.
Define Authentication Server
The first step in the EAP configuration is to define the authentication server and establish a relationship with
it.
      1. On the access point Server Manager tab (under the Security > Server Manager menu item),
         complete these steps:
               a. Enter the IP address of the authentication server in the Server field.
               b. Specify the Shared Secret and the ports.
               c. Click Apply in order to create the definition and populate the dropdown lists.
               d. Set the EAP Authentication type Priority 1 field to the server IP address under Default Server
                  Priorities.
               e. Click Apply.
You can also issue these commands from the CLI:
       AP#configure terminal
       Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
       AP(config)#aaa group server radius rad_eap
       AP(config−sg−radius)#server 10.0.0.3 auth−port 1645 acct−port 1646
       AP(config−sg−radius)#exit
       AP(config)#aaa new−model
            AP(config)#aaa authentication login eap_methods group rad_eap
            AP(config)#radius−server host 10.0.0.3 auth−port 1645
            acct−port 1646 key labap1200ip102
            AP(config)#end
            AP#write memory
2. The access point must be configured in the authentication server as an AAA client.
   For example, in Cisco Secure ACS, this happens on the Network Configuration page where the name
   of the access point, IP address, shared secret and authentication method (RADIUS Cisco Aironet or
   RADIUS Cisco IOS/PIX) are defined. Refer to the documentation from the manufacturer for other
   non−ACS authentication servers.
   Ensure that the authentication server is configured to perform the desired EAP authentication method.
   For example, for a Cisco Secure ACS that does LEAP, configure LEAP authentication on the System
   Configuration − Global Authentication Setup page. Click System Configuration, then click Global
   Authentication Setup. Refer to the documentation from the manufacturer for other non−ACS
   authentication servers or other EAP methods.
This image shows Cisco Secure ACS configured for PEAP, EAP−FAST, EAP−TLS, LEAP and
EAP−MD5.
Define Client Authentication Methods
Once the access point knows where to send client authentication requests, configure it to accept those
methods.
Note: These instructions are for a WEP based installation. For WPA (which uses ciphers instead of WEP),
refer to WPA Configuration Overview.
      1. On the access point Encryption Manager tab (under the Security > Encryption Manager menu
item), complete these steps:
      a. Specify that you want to use WEP encryption.
      b. Specify that WEP is Mandatory.
      c. Verify that the key size is set to 128−bits.
      d. Click Apply.
You can also issue these commands from the CLI:
         AP#configure terminal
         Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
         AP(config)#interface dot11radio 0
         AP(config−if)#encryption mode wep mandatory
         AP(config−if)#end
           AP#write memory
2. Complete these steps on the access point SSID Manager tab (under the Security > SSID Manager
   menu item):
       a. Select the desired SSID.
       b. Under "Authentication Methods Accepted," check the box labelled Open and use the
           dropdown list to choose With EAP.
       c. Check the box labelled Network−EAP if you have Cisco client cards. See the discussion in
           the Network EAP or Open Authentication with EAP section.
       d. Click Apply.
You can also issue these commands from the CLI:
         AP#configure terminal
         Enter configuration commands, one per line.               End with CNTL/Z.
         AP(config)#interface dot11radio 0
         AP(config−if)#ssid labap1200
         AP(config−if−ssid)#authentication open eap eap_methods
         AP(config−if−ssid)#authentication network−eap eap_methods
         AP(config−if−ssid)#end
         AP#write memory
Once you confirm basic functionality with a basic EAP configuration, you can add additional features and key
management at a later time. Layer more complex functions on top of functional foundations in order to make
troubleshooting easier.
Verify

Troubleshoot
Troubleshoot Procedure
Complete these steps in order to troubleshoot your configuration.
      1. In the client−side utility or software, create a new profile or connection with the same or similar
         parameters in order to ensure that nothing has become corrupted in the configuration of the client.
      2. In order to eliminate the possibility of RF issues that prevent successful authentication, temporarily
         disable authentication as shown in these steps:
                ♦ From the CLI, use the commands no authentication open eap eap_methods, no
                   authentication network−eap eap_methods and authentication open.
                ♦ From the GUI, on the SSID Manager page, un−check Network−EAP, check Open, and set
                   the dropdown list back to No Addition.
         If the client successfully associates, then RF does not contribute to the association problem.
      3. Verify that shared secret passwords are synchronized between the access point and the authentication
         server. Otherwise, you can receive this error message:
                   Invalid message authenticator in EAP request
                ♦ From the CLI, check the line radius−server host x.x.x.x auth−port x
                   acct−port x key <shared_secret>.
                ♦ From the GUI, on the Server Manager page, re−enter the shared secret for the appropriate
                   server in the box labelled "Shared Secret."
        The shared secret entry for the access point on the RADIUS server must contain the same shared
        secret password as those previously mentioned.
     4. Remove any user groups from the RADIUS server. Sometimes conflicts can occur between user
        groups defined by the RADIUS server, and user groups in the underlying domain. Check the logs of
        the RADIUS server for failed attempts, and the reasons those attempts failed.
Troubleshoot Commands
Certain show commands are supported by the Output Interpreter Tool ( registered customers only) , which allows
you to view an analysis of show command output.
